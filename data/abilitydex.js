		effectDescription: 'This Pokémon\'s moves completely ignore held items that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.\nFor example, this Pokémon\'s moves ignore items that would fully negate them, such as Air Balloon, and items that grant any general protective benefit, such as Yache Berry, Eviolite, Focus Sash/Focus Band or Bright Powder.  If an item could either hinder or help this Pokémon\'s moves, the item is ignored either way.\nHeld items that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  This ability cannot ignore type or form changes granted by items, for example Multitype or Giratina\'s Origin Forme.  This ability cannot ignore other effects of the target\'s held item; for example, it will not stop the target\'s Special Attack being raised by an Absorb Bulb, and it will not stop the bearer from taking damage if it triggers the target\'s Rowap Berry.\nAn item ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon\'s moves can paralyze a Pokémon holding a Cheri Berry, but the Cheri Berry will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter.\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.',

Self-inflicted stat drops (caused by either Pokémon, e.g. by Draco Meteor or Curse) are not affected by Scornful, nor are stat modifications caused by held items (e.g. Macho Brace) or by status conditions (e.g. paralysis).

Siphon does not increase the damage inflicted by the move itself.\nThis effect stacks with Big Root, such that HP-draining/regenerating moves will instead increase the HP restored by 1.69× while holding one.\nIf the target has Liquid Ooze, the HP lost is also increased by 1.3× (1.69× while holding Big Root).',

Other Pokémon\'s Ghost moves raise this Pokémon\'s Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\nIf the move\'s intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.\nFollow Me takes precedence over this ability.',

		effectDescription: 'This Pokémon is immune to all effects that have to do with physical contact. In other words, the Pokémon with Tough Hide is immune to the effects of Aftermath, Cute Charm, Effect Spore, Flame Body, Gooey, Iron Barbs, Mummy, Pickpocket, Poison Point, Poison Touch, Rough Skin, Static and Tangling Hair, and will not suffer the additional effects of Baneful Bunker, King\'s Shield or Spiky Shield. This means that if a Pokémon with Tough Hide uses an attack such as Tackle against an opponent that has the ability Flame Body, the 30% chance of burning due to a direct attack is nullified.\nAdditionally, this Pokémon ignores the damage boost that would be given by Tough Claws and takes normal damage from Pokémon with that ability.\nDamage and status effects caused by attacks and other effects are not nullified by Tough Hide, and other ability effects (such as those of Intimidate, Super Luck and Sand Veil) can still occur.',
